  All information contained within this document is correct to the best of our 
  (the contributors) knowledge only and thus should not be taken as a fact. One 
  should always verify information and seek knowledge when possible. This approach 
  is recommended by The Reading (<i>al quran</i>) itself. [<font color="#0000FF">17:36,

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Aim:</b> To 
  list <u>ALL the roots</u> used in <i>Al Quran</i>, including possible meanings (from 
SEVERAL Classical Arabic dictionaries/lexicons), give <u>ALL examples of usage</u> 
(allowing cross-reference) and detailed grammar information for <u>EVERY word</u> 
used. <span class="postbody">Its goal is to be the most comprehensive <i>Quran</i> 
study tool in the English language.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Why?</b> When 
  one reads a translation of <i>Al Quran</i>, they are actually reading the 
translator's interpretation of the original Arabic. Thus, mistakes are to be 
expected. A translation will have the translator's own 
thoughts/experiences/education/bias/imperfections. By listing the possible 
meanings of the roots with all of their occurrences &amp; comments on grammar, we allow you to study the 
meanings and usage for yourself. We hope this project 
  will aid the study of students of the scripture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some introductory 
  questions have been answered, aimed primarily at beginners:<br>
  <b><a href="Qwiar.htm">What is a root?</a><br>
  <a href="Qwribu.htm">Which root is being used?</a></b><br>
  <b><a href="Qwrmic.htm">Which root meaning is correct?</a> (a must read)</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To use, click on 
  the first Arabic letter of the root, from the Arabic letters shown above. The 
Arabic letters are arranged in a similar order to the English alphabet.</font></p>
