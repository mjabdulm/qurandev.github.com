5) ansha'a: From nasha'a = production/creation. Basically it has two meanings: i) to create a thing \n\
	ii) then to care for it & help in its growth/increase/to raise up.\n\
This word has been used both in individual meaning as well as in both meanings together.\n\
Ex: To create/give birth: see 6:98. To raise up/help grow: see 43:18. To create & raise up: see 56:72.\n\
6) dhara'a: i) to create/produce ii) to multiply. This word is used in both meanings, separately & jointly.\n\
Ex: To create: see 7:179. To multiply: 67:24. (ex: of a seed as well as man)\n\
sowed & multiplied; created & multiplied.	\n\n\
